# static-bins
A statically linked post-exploitation tools for Linux

## Notice
Mostly referenced [andrew-d](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries)'s linux binaries and those compiled by myself including Debian/CentOS official repositories.

I do not provide the build scripts (it's too much work). 
- You can choose to trust my binaries
- Or reverse them yourself to make sure you are safe

For [emp3r0r](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r) users, you can find files for `vaccine` module [here](./vaccine).
